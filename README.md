## Overview

This project aims to create a modern file storage and sharing solution, inspired by Google Drive, 
focusing on flexibility, security, and scalability. The system is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, 
and **MongoDB**, and integrates advanced features like **attribute-based access control (ABAC)** 
and optional mail quota management via **WildDuck**.

## Features

- **Flexible File and Folder Management**: Support for nested folders, group folders, and shared access.
- **Quota Management**: Optional integration with WildDuck for shared mail and file storage quotas.
- **ABAC Permissions**: Attribute-based permissions for secure and granular access control.
- **Sharing**: Share files and folders within an organization or with external users.
- **Deployment Ready**: Runs seamlessly as a systemd service or in a Docker container.
- **Scalable Storage**: Designed to handle a large number of files and users.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: ABAC integration with existing APIs
- **Deployment**: Dockerized setup with optional systemd support

## Installation and Setup
